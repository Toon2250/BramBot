Let's recap our conversation so far! We started with a question about what a certain "it" eats, and we discovered that "it" refers to cats! We learned that cats are carnivorous mammals that need a diet rich in animal-based protein sources, which includes meat, small animals, birds, and even insects. In the wild, they hunt for their food using their sharp claws, agility, and strong sense of smell. As domestic pets, they're often fed commercial cat food that provides them with the necessary nutrients for a healthy diet. However, when it comes to your original question about breeds, we didn't quite get there yet! You still need to specify what "it" refers to, whether it's a dog, cat, horse, or something else. Once we clarify that, I'd be happy to help you explore the different breeds associated with it.
